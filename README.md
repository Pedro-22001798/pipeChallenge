# Circuit Conundrum

## Brief overview:
### 1. How the project works:
As soon as the player loads the game he is presented with a level selection menu where he can see the unlocked levels (#1 only for default or more if the player already played before) and also the locked levels. Below every level button there are 3 stars.
They represent the best level score achieved.
After selecting a level by clicking on it. The level selection closes, sliding to the left of the scree, and a the level loads. A timer will start at the top of the screen and it is used to determine the final player score for the played level like this:
| Time To Complete      | Score |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 2+ min.      | 0 stars       |
| 1.2+m to 2m   | 1 star        |
| 30+s to 1.2m   | 2 stars        |
| 30-s   | 3 stars        |
